# Formula-Students-Gear-Shifting-Program

Critical part of the competetion is to justify every decision taken for the car, in previous years the team bought an already made steering wheel which was expensie. At the same time the driver was only using the steering wheel to control the wheels and shift gears. 

Therefore to be more cost efficient me and another team member designed built a circuitry with only the needed fucntions for the driver. From electronics point of view this was the gear shifting part. Instead of having an LCD screen we used seven segment display since you only need to see which gear you are currently at. Aso to shift the gears we used only push buttens which is cost efficient.

The circuit diagram is as shown below. The project was done by me and Ahemd Eldessouky, and the figure was done by Ciro Cursio.

The micocontroller used was Arduino Micro and the code is uploaded as Arduino code.txt

Please note this was only used for the application process. It resulted in both of us successfully pass to the next stage to be 2 of 16 out of 40 applicants.
